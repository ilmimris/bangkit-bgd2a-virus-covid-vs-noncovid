# OBJECTIVES
### PROBLEM FRAMING
    How to predict images from CT-Scan and X-Ray Chest infected Coronavirus or not?
### IDEAL OUTCOME
    * A success metric is that images can predict what CT-Scan or X-Ray Chest infected Coronavirus or not.
    * Success means the numbers of predicting upper 94% accuracy from that images. 
    * Failure means the result of predicting no better than heuristics.
### HEURISTIC
    * Consider collected images from the dataset that categories Covid19 or not in the past. Assume that images will labialize that Covid19 image or not.       
### FORMULATION
    * Image recognition using Transfer Learning with model sequential with using Covid Chestxray Dataset & Chest X-Ray From Kaggle 
    * Image recognition (alternative model) using Transfer Learning with model sequential with using Dataset Repository Mosmed COVID-19 CT Scans from Kaggle & COVID-CT from GitHub

### CONTEXT 
http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5

The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse â€˜â€˜interstitialâ€™â€™ pattern in both lungs.

### CONTENT

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patientsâ€™ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.

### About this dataset
This dataset contains anonymised human lung computed tomography (CT) scans with COVID-19 related findings, as well as
without such findings. In total, there are 1000 CT scans each from a unique patient.

A subset of 50 studies has been annotated with binary pixel masks for segmentation depicting regions of interest (ground-glass opacifications and consolidations).
CT scans were obtained between 1st of March, 2020 and 25th of April, 2020, and provided by medical hospitals in Moscow, Russia.

#### The utility of this dataset has been confirmed by a senior radiologist in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, who has performed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of COVID-19 patients during the outbreak of this disease between January and April.


After releasing this dataset, we received several feedback expressing concerns about the usability of this dataset. The major concerns are summarized as follows. First, when the original CT images are put into papers, the quality of these images are degraded, which may render the diagnosis decisions less accurate. The quality degradation includes: the Hounsfield unit (HU) values are lost; the number of bits per pixel is reduced; the resolution of images is reduced. Second, the original CT scan contains a sequence of CT slices, but when put into papers, only a few key slices are selected, which may have negative impact on diagnosis as well.


We consulted the aforementioned radiologist at Tongji Hospital regarding these two concerns. According to the radiologist, the issues raised in these concerns do not significantly affect the accuracy of diagnosis decision-making. First, experienced radiologists are able to make accurate diagnosis from low quality CT images. For example, given a photo taken by smart phone of the original CT image, experienced radiologists can make accurate diagnosis by just looking at the photo, though the CT image in the photo has much lower quality than the original CT image. Likewise, the quality gap between CT images in papers and original CT images will not largely hurt the accuracy of diagnosis. Second, while it is preferable to read a sequence of CT slices, oftentimes a single-slice of CT contains enough clinical information for accurate decision-making.

### Data Description

The COVID-CT-Dataset has 349 CT images containing clinical findings of COVID-19 from 216 patients. They are in ./Images-processed/CT_COVID.zip


Non-COVID CT scans are in ./Images-processed/CT_NonCOVID.zip


We provide a data split in ./Data-split. Data split information see README for DenseNet_predict.md


The meta information (e.g., patient ID, patient information, DOI, image caption) is in COVID-CT-MetaInfo.xlsx


The images are collected from COVID19-related papers from medRxiv, bioRxiv, NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, etc. CTs containing COVID-19 abnormalities are selected by reading the figure captions in the papers. All copyrights of the data belong to the authors and publishers of these papers.


The dataset details are described in this preprint: COVID-CT-Dataset: A CT Scan Dataset about COVID-19

# RESULTS

![results](results.png)

The Accuracy and Validation accuracy reaches 97% and 99%. That means the models have success metrics.

The graph titled "Training and Validation Accuracy" that could see, the distance of training data and validation is close so that overfitting does not occur.
